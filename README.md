## Abstract

Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders worldwide. Focal Cortical Dysplasia (FCD) is a major cause of drug-resistant epilepsy, often presenting as subtle lesions on MRI scans. While deep learning shows promise for automated FCD segmentation, existing methods achieved limited performance and used inconsistent dataset splits that prevent reproducible comparison. In this study, we propose an nnU-Net-based approach for automated FCD segmentation using the Bonn FCD Type II dataset. To improve model performance, our proposed approach employs oversampling of underrepresented FCD Type II radiological features and uses extensive augmentation during the training phase. We achieved an average validation Pseudo Dice of 0.56 compared to 0.45 in prior work, demonstrating significant performance improvement. This work provides the first complete evaluation on the dataset's standard train/test split, reporting both validation and test set performance to establish a reproducible benchmark for future method comparison. By providing both improved segmentation performance and a standardized evaluation framework, our work advances automated FCD segmentation toward better presurgical evaluation and improved outcomes for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy.

## Key Contributions

- **Reproducible Benchmark**: First complete evaluation on the Bonn FCD Type II dataset's standard train/test split, establishing a reliable baseline for future comparisons.
- **Improved Performance**: Achieved significant improvement in segmentation performance (Validation Pseudo Dice 0.56 vs. 0.45 in prior work) through radiological feature-based oversampling and extensive augmentation.
- **Radiological Feature-Awareness**: Addressed class imbalance by oversampling subtle and underrepresented radiological features (Transmantle Sign, Gray-White Matter Blurring).

## Methodology

### Pipeline Overview



- **Architecture**: nnU-Net (3d_fullres)
- **Data Splitting**: Adherence to the standard 57/28 train/test split to ensure reproducibility.
- **Preprocessing**: nnU-Net v2 automated preprocessing with resampling.
- **Radiological Feature-Based Sampling**: 3x oversampling for subjects with rare radiological features (Transmantle Sign, Gray-White Matter Blurring) to address class imbalance.
- **Extensive Augmentation**: Enhanced augmentation parameters to improve generalization:
    - **Rotation**: ±60°
    - **Scaling**: [0.70, 1.50]
    - **Brightness/Contrast**: [0.5, 1.5]
    - **Gaussian Noise**: $\sigma=0.2$
    - **Gamma**: [0.4, 2.0]

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 2.0+
- nnU-Net v2

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YassienTawfikk/nnU-FCD.git
   cd nnU-FCD
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Data Setup

1. Download the [Bonn FCD II dataset](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds004199).
2. Place the dataset in the `data/` directory.
3. Ensure `participants.tsv` is in `data/participants-data/`.

## Usage

The workflow is organized into sequential notebooks for reproducibility:

1. **Preprocessing**: `notebooks/00_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb`
   - Prepares the dataset for nnU-Net.
2. **Training**: `notebooks/01_Train_Oversampling.ipynb`
   - Trains the model with radiological feature-based oversampling.
3. **Inference**: `notebooks/03_Inference.ipynb`
   - Runs inference on the test set and generates evaluation metrics.

## Results

We evaluated our model on the standard train/test split.

### Ablation Study (Test Set)

Our ablation study demonstrates the progressive improvement of our contributions:

| Experiment | Best Val. PDS | Best Test DS |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| Baseline (BSL) | 0.545 | 0.168 |
| BSL + Oversampling (OVS) | 0.466 | 0.219 |
| **BSL + OVS + Augmentation (Proposed)** | **0.667** | **0.256** |
