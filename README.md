**Official PyTorch Implementation** of the paper: *Benchmarking FCD Lesion Detection: A Leakage-Free and Clinically Realistic Evaluation Framework*.

## Abstract

Epilepsy affects more than 60 million people worldwide, with approximately one-third experiencing drug-resistant epilepsy. Focal Cortical Dysplasia (FCD) is a major cause in these patients, frequently presenting as MRI-negative lesions that evade visual detection. Surgical resection offers potential seizure freedom, but success critically depends on accurate lesion localization. Current deep learning approaches report high segmentation performance; however, these metrics may be inflated due to evaluation protocols that permit data leakage and lack rigorous generalization testing.

This study establishes a **leakage-free benchmark** for automated FCD lesion segmentation using the histologically confirmed Bonn FCD Type II dataset. We enforce strict subject-level cross-validation to prevent slice-level data leakage and evaluate model performance without heuristic post-processing. Our **data-centric optimization strategy** prioritizes preservation of cortical boundaries and careful handling of rare, subtle lesion phenotypes (like Transmantle Sign and Gray-White Matter Blurring) often missed by standard architectures.

## Key Contributions

- **Leakage-Free Benchmark**: Strict subject-level cross-validation on the Bonn FCD Type II dataset to prevent slice-level data leakage.
- **Clinically Realistic Evaluation**: Evaluation on full 3D volumes without skull-stripping or heuristic post-processing (CCA), reflecting real-world clinical performance.
- **Phenotype-Aware Oversampling**: A novel data-centric strategy that prioritizes rare radiological signs (Transmantle Sign, Gray-White Matter Blurring) during training.
- **Transparent Baseline**: We expose the "Leakage Gap" in existing literature, where reported Dice scores (~0.45) are inflated by improper validation.

- **Architecture**: nnU-Net (3d_fullres)
- **Preprocessing**: No skull-stripping (preserves cortical boundaries).
- **Augmentation**: Aggressive spatial (±60° rotation, 0.7-1.5x scaling) and intensity transformations.
- **Sampling**: Custom `Abnormality-Aware Sampling` to oversample subjects with rare FCD features (3x frequency).
- **Leakage Prevention**: Validation and Test sets are strictly isolated at the subject level.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 2.0+
- nnU-Net v2

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YassienTawfikk/LesionSegmentation_X_Epilepsy.git
   cd LesionSegmentation_X_Epilepsy
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Data Setup

1. Download the [Bonn FCD II dataset](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds004199).
2. Place the dataset in the `data/` directory.
3. Ensure `participants.tsv` is in `data/participants-data/`.

## Usage

The workflow is organized into sequential notebooks for reproducibility:

1. **Preprocessing**: `notebooks/00_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb`
   - Prepares the dataset for nnU-Net.
2. **Training**: `notebooks/01_Train_Oversampling.ipynb`
   - Trains the model with phenotype-aware oversampling.
3. **Inference**: `notebooks/03_Inference.ipynb`
   - Runs inference on the test set and generates evaluation metrics.

## Results

Our rigorous evaluation establishes a realistic baseline for FCD detection, distinguishing true clinical utility from inflated metrics.

| Method | Validation Dice | Test Dice (Strict) | Notes |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| Baseline (Standard nnU-Net) | 0.45 ± 0.05 | -- | High variance, erratic convergence |
| **Proposed Framework** | **0.56 ± 0.18** | **0.23 ± 0.03** | **Stable convergence, captures rare phenotypes** |

*Table: Comparative benchmarking. Note that "Test Dice (Strict)" is lower than typical literature values (e.g., 0.41-0.45) because we prevent data leakage and do not use post-processing.*
